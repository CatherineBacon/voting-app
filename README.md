# Build a voting app

This app was created for a [FreeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app)

**See the final project [here](https://catherinepollsapp.herokuapp.com/)**

## Objective: 

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/).

### User stories: 

- As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
- As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
- As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
- As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
- As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. 
- As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

## Frameworks/Libraries

I used clementinejs as a project template and mongodb as the database.
